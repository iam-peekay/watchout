This is a reimplementation of [this game](http://latentflip.com/LearningD3/collider/) using [d3.js](http://d3js.org/). This was a non-traditional use of d3, which helped us a gain deeper knowledge of d3.js by using it in creative ways.

####Note
This is a project I completed as a student at [hackreactor](http://hackreactor.com). This project was worked on with a pair.
